# Face Recognition Using Pytorch

This is a repository for Inception Resnet (V1) models in pytorch, pretrained on VGGFace2 and CASIA-Webface.

Pytorch model weights were initialized using parameters ported from David Sandberg's [tensorflow facenet repo](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).

## Pretrained models

See: [models/inception_resnet_v1.py](models/inception_resnet_v1.py)

The following models have been ported to pytorch (with links to download pytorch `state_dict`'s):

|Model name|LFW accuracy (listed [here](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet))|Training dataset|
|-|-|-|
|[20180408-102900](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=12DYdlLesBl3Kk51EtJsyPS8qA7fErWDX) (111MB)|0.9905|CASIA-Webface|
|[20180402-114759](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1TDZVEBudGaEd5POR5X4ZsMvdsh1h68T1) (107MB)|0.9965|VGGFace2|

There is no need to manually download the pretrained `state_dict`'s; they are downloaded automatically on model instantiation. To use an Inception Resnet (V1) model for facial recognition/identification in pytorch, use:

```
from models.inception_resnet_v1 import InceptionResNetV1

# For a model pretrained on VGGFace2
model = InceptionResNetV1(pretrained='vggface2')

# For a model pretrained on CASIA-Webface
model = InceptionResNetV1(pretrained='casia-webface')

# For an untrained model
model = InceptionResNetV1()

# For an untrained 1001-class classifier
model = InceptionResNetV1(classify=True, num_classes=1001)
```

By default, the above models will return 512-dimensional embeddings of images. To enable classification instead, either pass `classify=True` to the model constructor, or you can set the object attribute afterwards with `model.classify = True`. For VGGFace2, the pretrained model will output probability vectors of length 8631, and for CASIA-Webface probability vectors of length 10575.

## Conversion of parameters from Tensorflow to Pytorch

See: [models/tensorflow2pytorch.py](models/tensorflow2pytorch.py)

Note that this functionality is not needed to use the models in this repo, which depend only on the saved pytorch `state_dict`'s. 

Following instantiation of the pytorch model, each layer's weights were loaded from equivalent layers in the pretrained tensorflow models from [davidsandberg/facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).

The equivalence of the outputs from the original tensorflow models and the pytorch-ported models have been tested and are identical:

In order to re-run the conversion of tensorflow parameters into the pytorch model, ensure you clone this repo _with submodules_, as the davidsandberg/facenet repo is included as a submodule and parts of it are required for the conversion.
